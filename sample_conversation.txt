Example: "Would you like a sports-themed graphic or something abstract?"

👤 You: abstract

🔄 Turn 3 | User: abstract
🎭 Supervisor analyzing request...
🎯 Decision: intent_classifier
💭 Reasoning: The user input 'abstract' is a single-word response that could be a clarification or a product search refinement (possibly referring to an abstract graphic pattern). There are no current search results, but historical results exist. No explicit cart or FAQ/analytics intent detected. The input is safe and in-domain.
